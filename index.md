On Thursday July 9, 2020, we're tuning in for [Devopsdays Amsterdam Online](https://devopsdays.org/events/2020-amsterdam/welcome/), where you'll hear all about...DevOps! To put all that knowledge to practice, we've built some **5 short coding challenges** for you to get started with GitHub Actions 🚀. Either during the breaks or after hours, feel free to give them a try and [let us know](https://twitter.com/msdev_we) what you think of them!

Wait. Devopsdays Amsterdam?

Yes, Devopsdays Amsterdam is a fun conference on all things DevOps. Join us at https://devopsdays.org/events/2020-amsterdam/program. You can still join by registering.


## But what does all this have to do with a Wall of Zen?

We have created a [Wall of Zen page](https://aka.ms/wallofzen) where you can post Zen quotes for the Devopsdays attendees. Under the hood it uses the [Octocat GitHub API](https://api.github.com/octocat).

We have prepared a sample Node.js application for you that exposes a REST API to post your quote on the wall. The goal of these coding challenges is to get this REST API up-and-running by creating a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.


## How does it work? 🧰

Just head over to our [Coding Challenge GitHub repo](https://github.com/GitHub-Coding-Challenge/devopsdaysams-actions) and get started with the coding challenges!

Thanks for participating in this coding challenge and keep learning! We have an extensive set of [free learning modules on how to automate using GitHub Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/automate-workflow-github-actions/?ocid=aid3016779) - highly recommended!!


## What else can I do?

Thanks for asking! **Follow** the [#devopswallofzen](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23devopswallofzen) Twitter hashtag, **bookmark** this page, and/or have a look at our [**MS Learn module**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/automate-workflow-github-actions/?ocid=aid3016779).
