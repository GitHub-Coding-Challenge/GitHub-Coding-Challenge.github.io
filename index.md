## Welcome to the devopsdays Wall of Zen coding challenge

{% include player.html id="aM78y5RCwPo" %}

On Thursday July 9, 2020, we're tuning in for [devopsdays oNLine](https://devopsdays.org/events/2020-amsterdam/welcome/), where you'll hear all about... DevOps! To put all that knowledge to practice, we've built **5 short coding challenges** for you to get started with GitHub Actions ðŸš€ 
Either during the breaks or after-hours, feel free to give them a try and [let us know](https://twitter.com/msdev_we) what you think of them!

Wait... devopsdays oNLine?

Yes, devopsdays oNLine is a fun conference on all things DevOps. You can still join by [registering](https://devopsdays.org/events/2020-amsterdam/program).


## But what does all this have to do with a Wall of Zen?

We have created a [Wall of Zen page](https://aka.ms/wallofzen) where you can post Zen quotes for the devopsdays attendees. Under the hood it uses the [Octocat GitHub API](https://api.github.com/octocat).

We have prepared a sample Node.js application for you that exposes a REST API to post your quote on the wall. The goal of these coding challenges is to get this REST API up-and-running by creating a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.


## Okay, I'm in. Let's build stuff! ðŸ§°

Just head over to our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/GitHub-Coding-Challenge/devopsdaysams-actions) and get started with the coding challenges!

If you're stuck, we'll be at our virtual conference booth of DevOpsDays AMS at the following times:
11:50-12:10, 12:45-13:00, 14:00 - 14:15 (CET)


Thanks for participating in this coding challenge and keep learning! We have an extensive set of [free learning modules on how to automate using GitHub Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/automate-workflow-github-actions/?ocid=aid3016779) - highly recommended!!


## What else can I do?

Thanks for asking! **Follow** the [#devopswallofzen](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23devopswallofzen) Twitter hashtag, **bookmark** this page, and/or have a look at the [**MS Learn module**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/automate-workflow-github-actions/?ocid=aid3016779) on GitHub Actions.
